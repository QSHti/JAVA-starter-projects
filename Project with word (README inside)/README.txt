1. Write a program to compute the number of words and characters in a string. (Main.java)

For example, a possible sample output might be
The string "Life is beautiful" contains
3 words and 15 characters.

2. Write a method that takes an array of words and prints the longest word and the length of the longest one. (Arrays.java)

Sample Output:
Longest word: Exercises
Length of the longest word: 9

3. Write a program to read first 14 lines from a file. (File.java)

4. Write a program that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases. (UpperRand.java)

5. Write a program that asks user for a sentence and prints the first word of the sentence. (FirstWord.java)

6. Write a program that starts with a line of text and then outputs that line of text with the first occurrence of "beautiful " changed to "tough". (Tough.java)

For example, a possible sample output might be
The line of text to be changed is:

I have rephrased that line to read:
Life is tough, and so are you.
