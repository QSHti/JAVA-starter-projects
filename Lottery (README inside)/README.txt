Write a lottery program that prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100000.
The user pays $1.00 for each guess, $2.00 for each hint, and wins $1,000,000 if the guess is correct.
The user enters a "q" to quit. If the user does not win, the program will show how much money the user lost.
If the user wins, the user will not lose the money - the winner takes it all - $1,000,000.

Example outputs:

Want to win a million dollars?
If so, guess the winning number (a number between 0 and 100000).
Insert $1.00 and enter your number or 'q' to quit:
50
Sorry, good guess, but not quite right. Do you want me to give you a hint (y|n)?
n
Insert $1.00 and enter your number or 'q' to quit:
q
You lost $1.00. Thanks for playing. Come again!
